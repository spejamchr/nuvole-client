    <p>
      Nuvole is a free end-to-end encrypted journaling app with the ability to share specific
      entries or whole journals with other usersâ€”without your journals ever being readable by the
      Nuvole servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your journal entries are yours. You can export your journals & entries in several convenient
      formats, including plain text, markdown, and html.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our client is completely open source, and we encourage others to implement their own clients.
